Analysis

The Capomulin and Ramicane drug regimens were the most effective in reducing tumor volume in mice. Infubinol and Ceftamin regimens had larger average final tumor volumes and greater tumor volume variance. A strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.84) was observed between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen. The linear regression plot confirmed that as mouse weight increased, average tumor volume also increased. Controlling for mouse weight is crucial when interpreting preclinical study results.

You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.


Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot (10 points)
A line plot is generated that shows the tumor volume vs. time point for one mouse treated with Capomulin. (5 points)
A scatter plot is generated that shows average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen. (5 points)
Calculate Correlation and Regression (10 points)
The correlation coefficient and linear regression model are calculated for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen. (10 points)
